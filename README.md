Login-Authentication-using-RSA---Windows-Form

- It is simple windows form of Login. 
- User enters username and password as per the guidelines. 
- When the user submits, I have used RSA algorithm to encrypt username and password. 

My main aim was to provide guidelines for selecting username and password. I can implement this method in any application which has login form.
I have also used RSA algorithm to encypt usename and password, this is very important as an hacker can get your details on the URL.
